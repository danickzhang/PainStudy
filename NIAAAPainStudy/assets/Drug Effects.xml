<!--  Chen, I am removing the Alcohol Intoxication Effects and Opioid Intoxication Effects items from the survey. 
	These items replace those, but in a different way (this is one of the things I'd like to go over in person with you). 
	These items should be asked anytime:
		1. Opioid pain medication is reported during a random prompt (1q8, 2q1)
		2. Alcohol use is reported during a random prompt (1q1, 2q2)
		3. Marijuana use is reported (12)
		4. During any initial prompt or followup report
		5. Any combination of the above
